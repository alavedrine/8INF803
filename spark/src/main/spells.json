Furthermore, when you are hit with an attack of opportunity, you can make a single attack with your antlers against the opponent that hit you as an immediate action.

If it doesn’t feel that way toward anyone, it instead perceives you as a stranger with features likely to evoke that emotion (e.g., if you choose respect, a guard who was taught to respect her elders but who currently knows no elders might see you as an elderly version of yourself). Since you don’t know how you will appear to each target, you must match your actions and statements to fit with the illusion as best you can. While the spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks like disguise self does, you also take a –5 penalty on Disguise checks until you can get a sense of who the target thinks you are. Each target who fails to disbelieve the phantasm and is fooled by your Disguise check takes a –2 penalty on Sense Motive checks to notice your lies, and each emotion choice grants you an additional benefit against such targets, as listed in the table below."

For example, if you and your allies are beating a member of the city guard for information, creatures within the area don’t think this is unusual or cause for alarm; if your ally is aiming a crossbow at the queen from a balcony, the affected creatures accept this as normal and unworthy of concern. Any hostile actions by you or your allies against a creature or its allies break the effect of the spell for that creature. When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions from the earlier events remain. Each mention of the events as noteworthy (such as being questioned about them by an authority figure) allows the target another Will save to break the effect and remember things normally."

A creature struck by any of these is subject to a bull rush attempt. The force has a Strength modifier equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). The CMB for the force’s bull rush uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, adding the force’s Strength modifier and a +10 bonus for each additional blast directed against the same target. Each sphere of force makes its own separate bull rush attempt—if multiple spheres strike one target, you make multiple CMB checks but only take the highest result to determine success. If the bull rush succeeds, the force pushes the creature away from you in a straight line, and the creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone. This spell pushes an unattended object struck by it 20 feet away from you, provided it weighs no more than 25 pounds per level (maximum 250 pounds). This spell cannot move creatures or objects beyond your range. Used on a door or other obstacle, the spell attempts a Strength check to destroy it if the sheer damage inflicted by the spell doesn’t do the job."

The reduction to natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum penalty/bonus of –5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell. All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures make this decision without any need for conscious thought or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any tactical advantage they might lose."

Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared."

Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them.

At your command, an invisible coachman similar to an unseen servant can assume the role of driver and direct the carriage, although it can’t perform any complex or dangerous driving, and fails any checks made to drive the carriage in such conditions. At the end of the spell’s duration, the carriage, horses, and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it on the ground in its space."

After the target’s next night’s sleep, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains asleep for the rest of the day and following night. Each night it must succeed at a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or weeks on end as it slowly starves to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud noises, jostling, and even pain won’t rouse the slumbering target. Dealing 1 point of damage per the target’s Hit Die awakens the target, but it awakens fatigued and takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws against spells and effects that may put it back to sleep until the phantasm has been banished."

The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints."

Creatures that succeed in their initial saving throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated.

However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a saving throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears. This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax, closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling into a barrel and pulling down the top. If a target that had previously made its saving throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers it must immediately make a new saving throw. Similarly, any target that had previously failed its saving throw gets a new save each time it gains the protection of a barrier."

An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can’t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone’s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge."

When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can’t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone’s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge."

In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell’s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact."

For the duration of the spell, any creature of your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10 Acrobatics check every round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed. If the creature takes a –5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed. If a creature fails an Acrobatics check, or if a creature that’s larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent creatures take a cumulative –5 penalty on their Acrobatics checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants. As you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell’s range. Otherwise, they remain until the spell’s duration expires."

The reflection is harmless and mimics the target’s motions perfectly; no one else can see this illusion. The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or shaken and take a –2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the spell’s duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster’s mirror mantis spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends."

When suffering from diseases, poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them track their recovery.

Once you have probed a target’s history, successfully or not, you cannot target the same creature’s history or search for the same information in another creature’s history."

Movement through the cylinder at normal speed requires a successful DC 10 Swim check (otherwise, creatures move at one-quarter speed). If conjured in an area with insufficient room for the entire cylinder, the cylinder attains its maximum possible size. It retains its shape in defiance of gravity for the spell’s duration, and any creature can enter or exit the cylinder’s sides as easily as stepping into or out of a pool of ordinary water. The water disappears at the end of the spell’s duration, so creatures swimming in the water immediately fall to the ground."

The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes in the rumor don’t interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends."

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints’ key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell’s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell’s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target’s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together."

The target takes a –1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target’s move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends."

Though creatures can’t have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove.

Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject."

In addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect."

Your hair receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that your hair succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. The CMD of your hair, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB."

The miniature ship must be elaborately carved and worth 10% of the price of the type of ship it represents. The ship comes with all equipment necessary for sailing or rowing the ship but provides no crew or cargo. If you attempt to conjure the ship into a location where there isn’t a sufficient amount of water to keep the ship afloat, the spell fails. The ship displaces all water and Medium or smaller aquatic animals within its space when it appears, but the location must be otherwise unoccupied at the time of casting the spell. You can cast this spell again to extend the duration of the conjured ship, replacing the remaining duration with the new spell’s duration. When the spell’s duration ends or the spell is dismissed, the ship instantly stops moving and then falls apart over the course of a minute."

When cast, all creatures under the effect of the spell must be adjacent to one another, forming an unbroken chain of squares (which may include creatures sharing the same square). This chain does not need to be a straight line. Each target in the chain receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC as long as the targets stay adjacent to at least one other creature affected by the spell; moving more than 5 feet from another target ends the spell with respect to that creature only. For example, a cleric could cast it on himself and four dwarves blocking a 20-foot-wide corridor; the cleric can move freely from the left side of the formation to the right side (whether in front of or behind the other targets) and not break the spell as long as he stays within 5 feet of at least one of them."

When you cast this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged illusion that ripples and flows in the area. Only you and up to six creatures you designate upon casting the spell can see the illusion. To designate a creature, you must know it well. It is not enough simply to have met that creature once or heard of the creature. When you move, this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale signs of which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find a middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking method for the caster’s handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and out of mazes or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an obvious trail."
